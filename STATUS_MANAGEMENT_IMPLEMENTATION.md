# Status Management Implementation Guide

## Overview
Implemented separate status tracking for delivery loading and stock receiving workflows instead of managing status in `purchase_order_header` table.

## Database Changes

### 1. DeliveryLoadingTracking Table
**New Column:** `Status` (VARCHAR(50), DEFAULT 'PENDING')

**Valid Status Values:**
- `PENDING` - Initial state when delivery loading is created
- `APPROVED_FOR_SHIPMENT` - When approved for shipment
- `SHIPPED` - When goods have been shipped

**Purpose:** Track the delivery/loading workflow stages independently

### 2. StockReceivingTracking Table
**New Column:** `Status` (VARCHAR(50), DEFAULT 'PENDING')

**Valid Status Values:**
- `PENDING` - Initial state when stock receiving starts
- `COMPLETED` - When stock receiving is complete

**Purpose:** Track the stock receiving workflow stages independently

## Migration Script
**Location:** `/backend/migrations/add_status_columns.sql`

**To Apply Migration:**
```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <username> -d <database> -f backend/migrations/add_status_columns.sql
```

## Backend Changes

### Models Updated:
1. `IDeliveryLoadingTracking.cs` - Added `Status` property
2. `DeliveryLoadingTracking.cs` - Added `Status` property
3. `IStockReceivingTracking.cs` - Added `Status` property
4. `StockReceivingTracking.cs` - Added `Status` property

### Data Layer Updated:
1. `PGSQLDeliveryLoadingTrackingDL.cs`
   - Added `Status` to all SELECT queries
   - Added `Status` to INSERT query with default 'PENDING'
   - Added `Status` to UPDATE query
   - Modified `GetByStatusAsync` to filter by `dlt."Status"` instead of `poh.status`

2. `PGSQLStockReceivingTrackingDL.cs`
   - Added `Status` to all SELECT queries
   - Added `Status` to INSERT query with default 'PENDING'
   - Added `Status` to UPDATE query

### Default Behavior:
- When creating new records, if Status is not provided, it defaults to 'PENDING'
- Status is preserved during updates unless explicitly changed

## Frontend Changes Required

### Services to Update:
1. **deliveryLoadingService.ts**
   - Add `Status` field to interface
   - Set status when creating/updating delivery loading records

2. **stockReceivingService.ts**
   - Add `Status` field to interface
   - Set status when creating/updating stock receiving records

### Example Usage:

#### Delivery Loading (activity-log page)
```typescript
// When submitting the form with "Shipped" status
const deliveryLoadingData = {
  ...existingData,
  Status: "SHIPPED",  // Set to SHIPPED when form is submitted
  // other fields...
};
```

#### Stock Receiving (stock-receiving page)
```typescript
// When completing stock receiving
const stockReceivingData = {
  ...existingData,
  Status: "COMPLETED",  // Set to COMPLETED when form is submitted
  // other fields...
};
```

## Workflow Status Transitions

### Delivery Loading Workflow:
```
PENDING â†’ APPROVED_FOR_SHIPMENT â†’ SHIPPED
```

### Stock Receiving Workflow:
```
PENDING â†’ COMPLETED
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Workflow status is tracked separately from purchase order status
2. **Better Tracking:** Each stage has its own status in its respective table
3. **Edit History:** Easier to track and edit workflow-specific data in the future
4. **Independent Workflows:** Delivery and receiving workflows can progress independently
5. **No Pollution:** Doesn't clutter the main `purchase_order_header` table with workflow statuses

## Database Indexes
Created indexes on Status columns for better query performance:
- `idx_delivery_loading_tracking_status`
- `idx_stock_receiving_tracking_status`

## Migration Status
âœ… Backend models updated

âœ… Backend compiled successfully
âœ… Migration script created
âœ… Database migration completed successfully
âœ… Frontend service interfaces updated with Status field
âœ… Activity log page updated to set Status = "SHIPPED"
âœ… Stock receiving page updated to set Status = "COMPLETED"

## Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All changes have been successfully deployed:
